For the graphic part I used the Pygame library. You need to download if you want tu use my program.
You can acces to the doc with this URL: https://www.pygame.org/docs/

To run the code, you have to launch the main.py file.

To format my code, i used the black library. You can download it by running: `pip install black`. To use black on a file, you have to run this command: `black file.py`.

For installing all dependencies, execute the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
